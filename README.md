# Deprecated Modules

Deprecated Modules is a module that will warn game masters whenever they use a module that they shouldn't be using anymore. This includes modules that have been integrated into core Foundry, modules that have been entirely replaced by other modules, and modules that have broken and are no longer being maintained.

Deprecated Modules is smart about which version of Foundry you're using when it checks your modules. For example, Deselection is a module that was integrated into core Foundry in 0.7.3. If you're using Deselection in an earlier version of Foundry, Deprecated Modules will not warn you about it.

# Module Developers

Deprecated Modules is integrated with Manifest+ to make it easier for you to mark your module as deprecated when you stop maintaining it.
Simply add the following fields to your module.json file, and any users who have Deprecated Modules installed will receive a warning for it. (The "reason" field is required, the rest are optional.)

```
"deprecated": {
  "coreVersion": "0.7.0",
  "reason": "This was added to foundry core.",
  "alternatives": [
    {
      "name": "module_name",
      "manifest": "https://link.com/to/manifest.json"
    }
  ]
}
```
