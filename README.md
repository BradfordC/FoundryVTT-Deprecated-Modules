# Deprecated Modules
Deprecated Modules is a module that will warn game masters whenever they use a module that they shouldn't be using anymore. This includes modules that have been integrated into core Foundry, modules that have been entirely replaced by other modules, and modules that have broken and are no longer being maintained.

# List of Deprecated Modules

### Integrated Into Core

These modules provided functionality that is now provided by core Foundry, and so are no longer needed. (You will not receive a warning if you're using a Foundry version earlier than when a module was integrated into Foundry.)
